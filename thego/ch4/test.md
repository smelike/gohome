A struct is an aggregate dat a type that groups toget her zero or more named values of arbitrary
types as a single entity. Each value is called a field. The classic example of a struct from data
processing is the employee record, whose fields are a unique ID, the employeeâ€™s name, address,
date of birth, position, salary, manager, and the like. All of these fields are collected into a single entity that can be copied as a unit, passed to functions and returned by them, stored in
arrays, and so on.
