In this tutorial you'll create two modules. 

The first is a library which is intended to be imported by other libraries or applications. 

The second is a caller application which will use the first.

This tutorial's sequence includes seven brief topics that each illustrate a different part of the language.

1. Create a module - Write a small module with functions you can call from another module.

2. Call your code from another module - Import and use your new module.

3. Return and handle an error - Add simple error handling.

4. Return a random greeting - Handle data in slices (Go's dynamically-size arrays).

5. Return greeting for multiple people - Store key/value pairs in a mao

6. Add a test - Use Go's built-in until testing features to test your code.

7. Compile and install the application - Compile and install your code locally.
